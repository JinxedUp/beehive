# beehive

**beehive** is a selfbot library made from the ground up to copy discord.py while being the safest option
offers more safety than all of the other python selfbot libraries.

v0.10 out now!
this version is kinda glitchy and has some broken code in it that im not willing to fix and upgrade for now.

## future updates 
i have lost motivation and ambition to continue this project but maybe ill continue fixing and adding new things to this to trully replace discord.py and other python selfbot libraries.
until then, feel free to fork this repo then make pull requests if thats what you would like. the entirety of this project can be used in any way you want due to the [license](./LICENSE)
