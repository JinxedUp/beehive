# jinxcord
Jinxcord is a selfbot library made from the ground up to copy discord.py while being the safest option
offers more safety than all of the other python selfbot libraries.

v0.10 coming soon, expect it to have basic things such as command and event handling and some other things.
each update will have more and more features until v1 which will also be released on pypi. 


## Features
- Easy-to-use **command** and **event** handling (coming soon in v0.10)
- Built with **safety** and **efficiency** in mind
- Full compatibility with **selfbots** on Discord
- Designed to provide a familiar, yet improved, API inspired by `discord.py`
